<p>In my hubris, I consciously used James Joyce's *Ulysses* as a model, as it
in turn used Homer's *Odyssey*. Originally, I had a schema mapping each
chapter to a particle, and each part to a philosopher, a stage of human
development, a poet, a physical theory, a stage of the evening, a drug,
and a decade. All of this went almost immediately out the window; if you
know of a good way to thematically center a chapter around the τ (tau
lepton), I'm all ears.</p>

<p>I had originally planned for 33 chapters across five parts.
It turned out being 29 chapters, plus an epilogue. The five parts
were retained. They're taken directly from Robert Anton Wilson's
<i>Illuminatus!</i> trilogy, where they're described as the five stages
of the Illuminati's cyclic theory of history. These are themselves an extension
from the three-part system of Joachim of Floris and the four-part system of
Giambattista Vico; interested readers ought consult that fascinating book,
especially its Appendix ג, "The Illuminati Theory of History".</p>
